# Interactive-Visualization--Project-1--sketch-and-description
The visualization project intends to evaluate the relationship between the type of car owned by a household (electric and non- electric) in the State of California and their socio-economic profile. The later years have seen a dramatic decrease in price for electric vehicles, which diminishes the purchasing gap between households with different characteristics. I am looking to find out what factors play the main role when selecting electric over the traditional choice in the US? The CSV was obtained from the National Center for Sustainable Transportation website leaded by UC Davis and other universities in California. The target public for this visualization will be car buyers, government officials in charge of sustainability, climate advocates, car makers, electric battery manufacturers, technology journalists, car engineers and the general public. I am hoping this data set will be enough for my purposes but I might explore data sets with information on battery performance.
